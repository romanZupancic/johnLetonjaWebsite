                <p>John Letonja is an inventor, social advocate, and a devoted family man who never stops working towards the common good. Toronto is a progressive city that has some challenges that he will be determined to meet and coordinate with his personal experience of living in the city. The diversification and growth of the city, throughout the years have given a different perspective to John.  
                <br><br>Toronto has become a key integral part of the cultural and economic hub in Ontario and it is the people that have contributed to this cohesion.  With Scarborough being a central influence to the landscape and influence to the vibrant city atmosphere.
                <br><br>A loving father himself, John knows the struggles of raising a family; that stress quickly builds up to a pressure point. As a goal that he is committed to is to make the accessibility, communication and interaction points a stress-free environment for the residents of Ward 20.  John wants to represent Ward 20 as a city councillor, for the good of the community and the city.</p>

                        <p>Running a government in the modern world is not easy, and many politicians frequently fall victim to the tactics of both their fellow councillors and outside sources. John Letonja promises to be a bastion of strength for the great people of Ward 20. He will stand up for YOUR common sense rights and lead YOU to a resolution for your cause. John is also adamant about not voting for new taxes: he sees them as a last choice, not the first resource. John is also a teacher of strength, and will gladly aid the mayor and council on how NOT to waste tax payer dollars; he will help get more from your tax dollars. John will also involve YOU in the decisions the City makes. He believes that online polls and other methods can help get the community involved.</p>

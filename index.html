                <p>John Letonja is an inventor, social advocate, and a devoted family man who never stops working towards the common good. Having lived in Toronto for his entire life, John knows that progressing this large and complex city can be extremely challenging, but he is determined to do just that. He has seen how quickly the great city of Toronto has grown in the past: from a small, inconsequencial town in Canada, to our country's largest cultural and economic source of growth. He also knows the people of Toronto, and is especially close with those of Scarbarough. A loving father himself, John knows the struggles of raising a family; that stress quickly piles up. John believes that the city government should not be a source of stress to the regular resident, and aims to make his term in office stress free for Ward 39. John Letonja wants to work with you to become Ward 39's next city councilor.</p>
